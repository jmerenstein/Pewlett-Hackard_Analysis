# An Analysis of Pewlett-Hackard

## Overview of Project
The overall goal of the project was to find how many employees are currently reaching the retirment age. The first part of the project was to determine how many currentl employees for each job title were about to retire. The second part of the project was to see how many current employees, who will be retiring soon, would be elligible for the mentorship progrsm. 

## Results
- The first main result from the initial analysis was that there was over 41,000 employees that are set to retire who were hired between 1/1/1952 and 12/31/1955.
- The second result from the first part of the analysis are that the two job titles with the most employees retiring are Senior Staff and Eingeneers. They both have over 14,000 employees who will be soon retiring. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/jmerenstein/Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv).  
- The third main result from the first part of the analysis is that by looking at that same retiring_titles.csv that there are only 5 managers set to retire soon.
- The main result from the second part of the analysis is that there are just ovear 1,900 employee who will be elligible for the mentorship program. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/jmerenstein/Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibilty.csv). 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main challenge of the initial Pivot Table analysis was to decide if I should just look at theater Kickstarter campaign or Kickstarter campaigns overall. Since, Louise is looking to fund her play I decided it would be best to just look at theater campaigns. The main challeneges I faced in the second part of the analysis of the anaylsis was correctly formatting the COUNTIFS function in Excel. It took me a couple of tries, but then I was able to accomplish it successfully.

## Results
- The main conclusions that I can draw from the analysis of the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Dates is that May and June have the most successful launches and December has the least amount of successful launches. So, I would advise Louise to start her campiagn in May or June.
