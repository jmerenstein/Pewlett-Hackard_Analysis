# An Analysis of Pewlett-Hackard

## Overview of Project
The overall goal of the project was to find how many employees are currently reaching the retirment age. The first part of the project was to determine how many currentl employees for each job title were about to retire. The second part of the project was to see how many current employees, who will be retiring soon, would be elligible for the mentorship progrsm. 

## Results
- The first main result from the initial analysis was that there was over 41,000 employees that are set to retire who were hired between 1/1/1952 and 12/31/1955.
- The second result from the first part of the analysis are that the two job titles with the most employees retiring are Senior Staff and Eingeneers. They both have over 14,000 employees who will be soon retiring. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/jmerenstein/Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv).  
- The third main result from the first part of the analysis is that by looking at that same retiring_titles.csv that there are only 5 managers set to retire soon.
- The main result from the second part of the analysis is that there are just ovear 1,900 employee who will be elligible for the mentorship program. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/jmerenstein/Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibilty.csv). 


## Summary
- There are going have to over 41,000 employees retiring with the upcoming "Silver Tsunami." With that being said there are over 1,900 qualified employees who can start mentoring the next generations. This would mean there would be about 1 mentor for every 21 employees. Based off of how Pewlett-Hackard's mentorship program works this could be enough people for the mentorship program.
